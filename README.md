# What I learned In Week 1

### Project Workflow
We worked on an exercise that helped us practice managing a file system in the BASH terminal. We used the following commands:
* Create files and directories
* Move files and directories
* Copy files into different directories
* Delete files and directories
* Git add, commit, and push (100 times)

This exercise was great practice to go over the BASH commands we learned in week-0. It also drilled down the git commands to make sure we're in the habit of managing our workflow.

### Markdown Portfolio
We started building our portfolio with Markdown. We learned a couple of new things along the way.
* How to include a hyperlink (for LinkedIn and GitHub)
* How to include an image or gif
* Option + Z will wrap text so you don't have to scroll right in VSC

I built a resume-like portfolio to start with.

### Intro to HTML
This was the highlight of the week for me. We learned the basics of HTML. 
* The basic HTML skeleton is the set of tags required of every HTML page we build.
  * `<html> <head> <title> <body>`
* HTML tags usually come in pairs like `<p> </p>`
  * There are some self-closing tags such as `<img src>`
* There are a few things that HTML can do but Markdown can't
  * Create a form or input
  * Have multiple pages
  * Attributes
  * Apply CSS
  * Include JS for functionality
We learned how to use snippets in VSC. Colin's snippet for HTML would automatically setup the skeleton.

### Markdown Portfolio to HTML
This exercise was challenging because we had to look up new tags we didn't learn to incorporate into our HTML portfolio. 
* The Live Server extension is a "preview" of what the HTML page will look like
* Created a text input box and button
* How to link to an external site that opens in a new window/tab using the `_blank` tag
* Adjusting an image's size by including the `<height>` `<width>`
